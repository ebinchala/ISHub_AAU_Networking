Part A – IP Addressing Basics
1. What is an IP address and why is it important in a network?
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. It allows devices to locate and communicate with each other across a network, including the internet.
Importance:
# It identifies devices on a network uniquely.
# Enables routing of data from source to destination.
# Helps in network management and control.
# Essential for troubleshooting connectivity issues.

2.Differentiate between IPv4 and IPv6 in terms of: 
 # IPv4: 
    Address length ==== 32Bits 
    Notation format ==== Dotted decimal (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
    Number of addresses ==== 4.3 billion (2³²)
# IPv6: 
    Address length ==== 128 Bits
    Notation format === Hexadecimal, colon-separated (e.g., 2001:db8::1)
    Number of addresses ==== 340 undecillion (2¹²8)
    
3. Write the binary equivalent of the IPv4 address 192.168.10.1.
We convert each octet to binary:

    192 --- 11000000
    
    168 --- 10101000
    
    10 --- 00001010
    
    1 --- 00000001
    Binary equivalent:
    11000000.10101000.00001010.00000001

4. Convert the following binary IP address to decimal:
11000000.10101000.00000001.00000010
Break each octet into decimal:

    11000000 --- 192
    
    10101000 ---168
    
    00000001 ---1
    
    00000010 ---2

Decimal IP address: 192.168.1.2

5. What are the ranges of Class A, B, and C IPv4 addresses?

    Class A: 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255
    Class B: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
    Class C: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255

6. Which IP class does the address 172.16.5.4 belong to?
The IP address 172.16.5.4 falls within the range of Class B (128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255), so it belongs to Class B.

7. What is the difference between public IP and private IP? List private IP ranges.
Public IP: Assigned by ISPs and used to communicate over the internet. They are globally unique.
Private IP: Used within local networks and are not routable on the internet. They help conserve public IPs.
    
    Private IP ranges:
    Class A: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
    Class B: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
    Class C: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255


8. What is the role of loop back address in IP networking?
The loop-back address, usually 127.0.0.1, is used to test network software on the local machine. It allows a system to send and receive data to itself without involving the network interface. It helps in testing TCP/IP stack functionality without actual network hardware.

9. Explain the use of static IP vs dynamic IP with examples.
    Static IP: A fixed IP address manually assigned to a device. It does not change.
Example: A server with static IP 192.168.1.10 so that clients can always reach it.
    
    Dynamic IP: Automatically assigned by a DHCP server and may change over time.
Example: A home computer receiving IP 192.168.1.25 from the router temporarily.
    

10. What is the default subnet mask for:

    Class A ---255.0.0.0
    Class B ---255.255.0.0
    Class C ---255.255.255.0


11. What is sub-netting and why is it used?
    Sub-netting is the process of dividing a large IP network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks (subnets). It is used to improve network performance, enhance security, and efficiently utilize IP addresses.
    Why it's used:
    Reduces network congestion
    Improves security and isolation
    Optimizes IP address usage
    Simplifies network management

12. Given the IP address 192.168.1.0/24, how many total IP addresses are available?
    A /24 means 32 – 24 = 8 bits are available for hosts.
Total IPs = 28 = 256 IP addresses


13. From question 12, how many usable host IPs are there?
Out of the 256 total IPs, 2 are reserved (network and broadcast addresses).
Usable host IPs = 256 – 2 = 254

14. How many subnets can be created from a /24 network if you borrow 2 bits?
If you borrow 2 bits from the host portion:
- Number of subnets = 2^2 = 4.

15. What will be the new subnet mask if you borrow 3 bits from a /24 network?
Original subnet mask: /24 (255.255.255.0)
Borrow 3 bits: New subnet mask = /24 + 3 = /27 (255.255.255.224).

16. Given IP: 192.168.10.0/26
    - How many hosts per subnet?
      Host bits = 32 - 26 = 6
      Hosts per subnet = 2^6 - 2 = 64 - 2 = 62.
    
    - How many subnets can be created?
      Default network is /24, borrowed bits = 26 - 24 = 2
      Number of subnets = 2^2 = 4.
    
7. Calculate the first and last usable IP address in the subnet 192.168.10.64/26.
    - Network Address: 192.168.10.64
    - Broadcast Address: 192.168.10.127
    - First Usable IP: 192.168.10.65
    - Last Usable IP: 192.168.10.126

18. Identify the network address and broadcast address of 10.0.0.0/22.
    - Network Address: 10.0.0.0
    - Broadcast Address: 10.0.3.255

19. Fill in the blanks:
    - CIDR /30 gives 2 usable IP addresses.
    - CIDR /28 supports 14 hosts per subnet.

20. You are given the address block 172.16.0.0/20.
    - How many subnets can be created if you want each subnet to support at most 510 hosts?
      - Required host bits: log2(510 + 2) = 9 ? /23 subnet mask (32 - 9 = 23)
      - Original /20 network has 12 host bits (32 - 20 = 12)
      - Borrowed bits for subnetting: 23 - 20 = 3
      - Number of subnets: 2³ = 8
    
    - What will be the subnet mask?
      - Subnet mask: 255.255.254.0 (or /23)
